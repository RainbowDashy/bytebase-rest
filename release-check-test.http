### Test CheckRelease with changed-but-applied release file
# This tests that CheckRelease warns about a release file that has been executed
# but has a different sha256 hash (simulating a file that was changed after execution)
# Original statement was: "CREATE TABLE tbl1(id int);\n"
# Modified statement: "CREATE TABLE tbl1(id int, name varchar(100));\n"
